# BBC-New-classification
- In this project, my team and I developed a **basic news classification model** that primarily demonstrates the **accuracy** and **classification performance** on testing data.  

- **Potential enhancements** include implementing a feature where users can input text for real-time classification.  

- The model could be further improved by integrating advanced techniques such as using the **BERT model** for more accurate and robust classification.
